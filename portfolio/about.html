                <h1>About Me:</h1>
                <p>My name is Faisal, I'm from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahrain" target="_blank">Bahrain</a>. I just moved to the U.S in September of 2021 and im a marketing major. I have had some experience with HTML, CSS, and Javascript prior to this class as when I was younger I used to play this thing called FiveM, which was an addon to a game. I coded on it occasionally and it used lots of Javascript and HTML for the UI. My other experiences with coding are just LUA for a game called Garrys Mod.</p>
